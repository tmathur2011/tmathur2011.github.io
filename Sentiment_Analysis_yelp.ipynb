       " 'Okay, to begin, the pizza is delicious! We had the lasagna and margarita and both were tasty! Very thin crust, soft and chewy. All ingredients were fresh and pizza sauce was great!Here comes the 4-star, our service was subpar. Our waitress seemed to be at the end of her shift and was not very attentive. & lastly, our panini was dry. The balsamic glaze made it more enjoyable. Also to note, they do not press the meats, veggies, cheese, etc and only press the bread (like what lol) & again super dry!To conclude, service cannot be perfect every time and I would stick with the pizza and a side salad! Awesome lunch/light dinner spot.',\n",
       " \"Really excellent Neapolitan pizza in a homey space. Everything on their menu is amazing, but my absolute favorite thing on their menu is the Bianca. They add tomato slices and so much garlic and it's just such a good combination with the chewy thin dough. The pizzas are always fast to come out after you order so there's never too long of a wait once you're seated, but getting seated does often take a while since the space is pretty small and it's a really popular spot. Don't miss out on their gelato either -- there are always so many fun flavors and you can get multiple in a single cup to try more flavors. It's the perfect sweet treat to end off the meal!\",\n",
       " 'We had caprese (my friend loves it so much but so so for me) as appetizer, and tried Pizza Del Re and Pizza Della Casa, the pizza dough is thin crust and kind of chewy and elastic but not so crunchy, while the combination of sauce and topping is fantastic.Never forget to enjoy their signature gelato before leaving, I chose the chocolate by death and tiramisu in a small cup. Definitely the best of all!',\n",
       " \"Mercurio's is in every way perfect. That's really all there is to say. I have always loved the Diavola pizza, but on my most recent visit, I was surprised to find a pistacchio & mortadella pizza on the menu (and a few other new ones) and it's so good it'll make you want to cry. Yes, THAT GOOD. (The other pic is of my husband's salsiccia & funghi pizza.)\",\n",
       " \"Love Mercurio's! The pizza is delicious and the service is friendly. Located on Walnut street in Shadyside, is the perfect place to stop in for lunch when out shopping. And don't skip the dessert! The Nutella pizza is a must try item, but the gelato is what they're known for. It's the perfect treat in a hot summer day (or anytime really).\",\n",
       " \"despite being someone who normally dislikes pizzas (especially from pizza chains) i love love love mercurio's pizzas! they taste amazing, have plenty of toppings, and aren't too salty or oily. popular for a reason!love the interior too, very cute (the gelato bar is a plus)\",\n",
       " \"I was very excited to try this restaurant. When we first went in , the place was not crowded. Still, we were sat at a skinny little table in the back right corner that was next to the kitchen area .It was hot and noisy there. We shrugged it off and placed our order . The food was a big disappointment . The pizza was both soft and burnt at the same time ! The cheese slid off of the pizza and had to be added back on by the diner .It had such a serious flop that it needed to be eaten with a knife and a fork.The final straw was finding a small hair in my Gelato. The waiter couldn't have been more surly,and even had an attitude about giving us a box .With a zillion or more pizza joints in the Burg, I'd place this one at the bottom .\",\n",
       " \"I recommend this place - BUT - dine in. These pies don't travel well. They're uber-thin and def tasty, but even in my 10-min drive home, they were pretty beat and cold. Now- the good news! The crust is flavorful with its blistered edges straight from the oven, the marinara quite good, and the Buffalo mozz def fresh. We got 3 pies - which are pretty small: Margherita con Buffalo (self explanatory), Provola (smoked mozz - which didn't really come thru with much smoked flavor, leaving us feeling like we had 2 of the same margherita pizzas), and Funghi (same as margherita add mushrooms). The latter was by far our fave. It was meatier and more substantive. Next time we'll definitely get some kind of salad and maybe have olives added. The pizzas are good, but there's really not much to them. DEF will have gelato next time. Omg did it look great. This place - with its fast casual vibe (this is not date night material) - was packed. The kitchen incredibly busy. Definitely will return...\",\n",
       " \"Love their pizza! The crust is magical and delicious. I don't know what their secret is to make the crust just the right amount of chewiness. I've tried several different kinds of pizzas and the toppings are always fresh. Maybe add a bit more of the toppings if I had to say something that could make it better. Also the gelato is amazing. So many flavors and super yummy. For the most part we get takeout but have on occasion eaten there. The staff is always very friendly and does a good job. Highly recommend this place!\"]"
